The basic principle of this program is to use main class to implement the whole program and only the most essential classes were created.
I know we can use interface, inheritage and polymorphism to decrease the coupling between classes.
And I also konw that there are a lot of code copying remain me to optimization.
But just take it as a exercise and do not conplain too much ;)
